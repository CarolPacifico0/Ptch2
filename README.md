The PTCH2 gene encodes a transmembrane receptor belonging to the patched gene family, which plays a critical role in the Hedgehog signaling pathway. Alterations in this gene have been linked to various conditions, including nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome, basal cell carcinoma, medulloblastoma, and susceptibility to congenital macrostomia.

During my internship at the University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP), I conducted research on medulloblastoma, a pediatric brain tumor, which deepened my interest in the genetic mechanisms underlying this disease. This project focuses on analyzing PTCH2 mutations and their potential impact on medulloblastoma development.

Using data from the COSMIC database and bioinformatics tools like BLAST and ClinVar, I performed a comprehensive analysis of PTCH2, exploring potential pathogenic variants and their implications in cancer biology.
