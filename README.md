#  PTCH2 in Medulloblastoma – Data Curation, Preprocessing & Visualization

This project performs a complete workflow for analyzing mutations in the **PTCH2** gene within medulloblastoma datasets, with potential applications in pediatric oncology research and clinical-genomic integration.

## Pipeline Overview
The workflow includes:
1. **Data curation** – import and structure genomic mutation data from validated sources.
2. **Preprocessing & cleaning** – remove inconsistencies, filter irrelevant entries, and standardize formats.
3. **Visualization** – generate high-quality plots to highlight mutation frequency and distribution.

 **Full analysis notebook:** [Open in Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1QjyFxhLiHJ8ZqVyR-IRyIoQqt32NNw9z)  
 **Tech stack:** Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
 This repository can serve as a template for reproducible mutation analysis pipelines in other genomic projects.

##  Results
The analysis focused on **PTCH2** mutations in a medulloblastoma dataset, filtered for **Central Nervous System (CNS)** samples.

**Key findings:**
- **Mutation types:** Only *missense* and *silent* alterations were detected in PTCH2;
- **Most mutated sample:** Sample ID **2813454**;
- **Mutation frequency:** PTCH2 alterations account for a relevant portion of mutations in the CNS subset.
